A skeleton web project.

Idea is to introduce a layout and structure that could be used along
with any web-app (built with java/clojure/nancyfx)

##Tools:

* ES6
* JSPM w/ Babel
* EditorConfig for code format consistency
* standard & gulp-standard for javascript lint
* mocha w/chai for tests
* Karma for running tests

##Todo:

* gulp tasks for karma
* segregate unit and e2e test with mocks for js
* live coding and debug lifecycle
* sample with fetch api
* sample with promises and adding chai-as-promised with karma
