A skeleton web project.

Idea is to introduce a layout and structure that could be used along
with any web-app (built with java/clojure/nancyfx)

##Tools:

ES6
JSPM w/ Babel
EditorConfig for code format consistency
standard & gulp-standard for javascript lint
mocha w/chai for tests
Karma for running tests

##Todo:
gulp tasks for karma
segregate unit and e2e test with mocks for js
live coding and debug lifecycle
sample with fetch api
sample with promises and adding chai-as-promised with karma
